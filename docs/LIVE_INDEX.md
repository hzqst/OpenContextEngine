# Workspace indexing and automatic updates

The persistent service supports saved files in any local repository. First access builds a complete index. Later updates detect changes by file-content hash, reuse embeddings for unchanged code units, build a new version in the background, and switch versions atomically. No prior Git commit is required.

## Run a separate service from source

Supported platforms are macOS / Linux / Windows, requiring Node.js 22.14+, Python 3.10+, and Git. Native Windows support requires version 0.1.3 or later. Repositories with Go files also require a Go compiler. Models run through configured remote embedding and reranking services, without local model loading. For ordinary MCP use, follow the [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) and run `open-context-engine setup`; a separate HTTP service is unnecessary.

```sh
npm ci
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
# Set model endpoints and OCE_API_KEY (at least 24 characters) in .env.
npm run serve-retrieval -- --root /absolute/path/to/repository --port 23505
```

On Windows, create and install the source environment in PowerShell:

```powershell
npm ci
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Set model endpoints and OCE_API_KEY (at least 24 characters) in .env.
npm run serve-retrieval -- --root "C:\Users\you\project" --port 23505
```

npm installations use the Python environment created and saved by `setup`. Source installations can select an interpreter with `OCE_PYTHON`; otherwise, compatible locations such as the source directory's `.venv` are checked before falling back to `python3` on macOS/Linux or `python` on Windows. Virtual environments use `bin/python` on macOS/Linux and `Scripts/python.exe` on Windows. Select the Go compiler with `OCE_GO_BINARY`. Enable Go type analysis with `OCE_LANGUAGE_OPTIONS='{"go":{"mode":"types"}}'`; syntax-based structure analysis remains the default.

Indexes default to `~/.cache/opencontextengine/<repository-path-hash>/`; override this with `--state /outside/repository/index`. Existing installations automatically reuse their previous cache directory. Keep the state directory outside the source directory to avoid indexing its own output. Only one process may write to a state directory. After stopping the service, deleting the entire state directory removes source copies and vectors. Historical vectors are retained to reuse content when switching branches.

Without `--root`, the HTTP command `serve-retrieval` retains the original frozen-index mode for earlier evaluations and services.

Without `--root`, `npm run mcp` uses automatic-workspace mode. The agent passes an absolute `directory_path` to every `search_code` or `index_status` call. MCP processes share one worker per state directory, including concurrent first access: the writer lock elects a worker, and other clients discover its authenticated loopback endpoint through private `worker.json` records. Paths are normalized to real directories. After a worker exits, the next access restarts it and reads the persistent index. In automatic mode, `--state` is the cache base directory, with a separate path-hash subdirectory for each project.

Each MCP process maintains a renewable lease. Disconnecting releases only that client's lease; other clients continue using the worker. A crashed client's lease expires after 15 seconds. The worker exits after all leases expire or are released and active searches finish, followed by 30 idle seconds. A worker that starts without any client connecting also exits after 30 seconds. Discovery validates the instance, protocol, runtime and effective configuration; incompatible clients receive an explicit error rather than silently using different model or indexing settings. Close existing clients before changing configuration for a shared index. Workers from older versions and manually started HTTP services do not advertise shared discovery; stop those services normally before using the same index with automatic MCP workers. Do not delete a live writer's lock.

MCP's `--root` fixes one project and rejects switches to other directories. `--connect` connects to an existing service and does not accept `directory_path`. Model configuration precedence is process environment variables → user settings saved by `setup` → `.env` in the OpenContextEngine source directory. The target project's `.env` is not read.

## Update rules

- By default, scan Git-tracked files and new unignored files every second. Non-Git directories use the same text-admission rules. Read saved disk content, not unsaved editor buffers.
- Debounce consecutive changes for 300 milliseconds before building. Adjust this with `OCE_POLL_SECONDS` and `OCE_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`.
- `OCE_EXCLUDE_SUFFIXES` keeps extra file endings out of the index, for example `OCE_EXCLUDE_SUFFIXES=.md,.mdx` to index code without documentation. Entries are comma separated, are matched case-insensitively against the end of the file name, and must start with a dot. Excluded files are reported with the reason `configured-exclusion`. This applies to automatic scanning and to an explicitly supplied snapshot; the setting is empty by default, so documentation is indexed as lossless text chunks unless it is configured.
- One worker writes a state directory at a time. `writer.lock` excludes other writers; shared MCP clients attach to the winner. A client that serves no request for five idle minutes releases its lease (`OCE_WORKER_IDLE_SECONDS`; `0` keeps its lease for the whole session). The worker exits once all clients have released their leases or their leases have expired.
- Handle additions, edits, deletions, renames, `git switch`, and `git pull` through content differences. Deleted files' units and references do not enter the new version.
- Reuse text parsing per file. Python, JS/TS, and Go relationships can cross files, so a changed language group is conservatively reanalyzed in full; other groups are reused. JS/TS share a group, and Go module-path configuration changes also refresh parsing. Compiler-level minimal dependency invalidation is not implemented.
- Embedding cache keys include the provider, model name, dimensions, revision, and complete actual model input. Reuse vectors when only line numbers change. Re-embed when a rename changes the path in the input. Relationship changes do not require new embeddings if the model input stays the same.
- Changes to `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `OCE_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`, or the provider create a new vector-cache identity. When weights change under the same model name, increment `OCE_EMBEDDING_REVISION`. Historical evaluations used Qwen3-Embedding-4B / 1024 dimensions; configure the actual dimensions returned by your service rather than copying the benchmark value. Other models must support the current source-retrieval input format and be evaluated separately.
- Write index files into a separate version directory, then atomically replace the version pointer. Requests use a fixed in-memory version. Model failures, syntax errors, or changes during a build do not overwrite the complete active version.

Synchronization uses automatic incremental polling rather than filesystem event watching. Scan and structural reanalysis costs on large repositories still require separate validation.

## Query consistency

`POST /search` accepts `query`, `budget`, `trace`, and optional `freshnessWaitMs` (default 30 seconds, maximum 120 seconds). Each query first scans current source and waits for its matching index; file hashes are verified again after retrieval. Successful results include `index.identity` and `freshness: verified-after-search`.

Source changes during retrieval, update failures, or wait timeouts return HTTP 503 with explicit index status, instead of presenting old source as current. A failed update names its exception type and message, and the writer logs one traceback per failing source state to stderr. Source can change again after a response, so agents should still read target files before editing.

`GET /status` uses the same Bearer authentication as search and returns `starting / updating / ready / failed`, the current version, changed-file counts, reuse counts, and the latest error type and reason. Status reflects the most recent background observation; searches perform an additional active check. `GET /healthz` indicates process liveness, not index readiness.

Added regression coverage includes additions/edits/deletions/renames, vector reuse after line-number changes, branch-content restoration, persistent caches, cross-file reference refresh, empty repositories, edits during builds, failure recovery, syntax errors blocking stale results, failure reasons reaching clients and logs, and the single-writer constraint.
