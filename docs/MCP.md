# MCP integration

OpenContextEngine uses the official TypeScript MCP SDK's stdio transport and provides two tools:

- `search_code(directory_path, query, budget=4000, freshnessWaitMs=30000)`: search the specified repository's current source and return file paths, original line numbers, evidence snippets, and the index version.
- `index_status(directory_path)`: check index readiness, changed-file counts, embedding reuse, and the most recent update error.

The implementation uses the [official SDK's stdio and tool registration interfaces](https://ts.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/server).

In the default automatic-workspace mode, the agent must pass the project's absolute path as `directory_path` to both tools. Model calls use the configured remote embedding and reranking services; no additional GPT endpoint is required.

## Use with one client

Follow the [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) to install and run `open-context-engine setup`. The example below is for clients that accept `mcpServers` JSON and can find the CLI on `PATH`. For Codex TOML and absolute-path configurations, see [client setup notes](QUICKSTART.md#client-setup-notes).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-context-engine": {
      "command": "open-context-engine",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Configuration precedence is: process environment variables → user settings saved by `setup` → `.env` in the OpenContextEngine source directory. The searched project's `.env` is not read. The default index location is `~/.cache/opencontextengine/<repository-path-hash>/`; override it with `--state /outside/repository/index`.

The default mode is not tied to one project. On first access to a project path, the service starts a local HTTP worker with a dynamic port and authentication key. Later requests reuse its worker and index. One MCP session can search multiple projects. Initial indexing runs in the background, and searches wait for synchronization; use `index_status` to check progress first.

To use a fixed project, append `"--root", "/absolute/path/to/your-repository"` to `args`. Tool calls may then omit `directory_path`; if provided, it must refer to that same project.

MCP processes share authenticated repository workers across sessions. When a client closes, stdin reaches EOF, or a termination signal arrives, it releases its leases without stopping workers used by other clients. Five idle minutes also release that client's repository lease (`OCE_WORKER_IDLE_SECONDS`; `0` keeps it for the whole session). Crashed clients stop renewing their leases, which expire after 30 seconds. Workers exit after all leases end and active requests finish. The next search connects to the existing worker or starts a replacement from the saved index. stdout carries only the MCP protocol; shared worker diagnostics go to `worker.log` in the index directory. Different effective model or indexing configurations cannot share a running worker; close its clients before changing settings.

## Share a repository across clients

This is an optional setup for source installations. An index directory permits only one writer. To let multiple clients search the same repository simultaneously, start a separate persistent service from the OpenContextEngine source directory:

```sh
# Set OCE_API_KEY in .env to at least 24 characters.
npm run serve-retrieval -- --root /absolute/path/to/your-repository --port 23505
```

Use the following command in each MCP client, with the same service key:

```json
{
  "command": "open-context-engine",
  "args": ["mcp", "--connect"],
  "env": {
    "OCE_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:23505",
    "OCE_API_KEY": "replace-with-at-least-24-random-characters"
  }
}
```

`--connect` only connects to the service. Omit `directory_path` from tool calls; closing MCP does not stop the shared service. Use HTTPS or an explicit local SSH forward when connecting to a remote worker. The MCP search tool requires a live index started with `--root`; it does not treat an old frozen evaluation index as the current workspace.

## Behavior while editing

Save files normally; no manual rebuild or Git commit is required. By default, changes are checked every second, with consecutive edits debounced for 300 milliseconds. Searches also actively check current file hashes:

1. Synchronized: search the complete version immediately.
2. Updating: wait within `freshnessWaitMs`, defaulting to 30 seconds and capped at 120 seconds. For large initial indexes, call `index_status` first.
3. Parsing or model failure, wait timeout, or source changes during retrieval: return `isError: true` with an explicit reason so the agent can check status or retry.

Only saved files are processed; the index cannot read unsaved code. See [automatic updates](LIVE_INDEX.md) for default exclusions, model changes, persistent-cache removal, and the scope of structural reanalysis.

## Validation

These commands are for source development and maintenance. Install development dependencies and the test Python environment first.

```sh
npm test
OCE_GO_BINARY=/path/to/go .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*_test.py'
# Calls configured real remote models and saves results under .pilot-state/mcp-smoke.
node scripts/smoke-mcp.mjs --auto-workspace
```

Automated tests use the official MCP client for real stdio handshakes, tool discovery, input validation, retrieval after saved edits, and update failures. Deterministic model protocol stubs check service behavior.

A separate real remote-model smoke test completed on 2026-10-04 (Beijing time): initial indexing and retrieval, embedding only 1 new unit while reusing 2 after a Python edit, removing corresponding evidence after deleting a JS file, and restoring the same index version after closing and restarting MCP. See the [MCP smoke results](eval/results/mcp-live-smoke-20261004.json). This validates the integration and update correctness, not retrieval quality. The three queries, including index waits, took 3.61, 5.29, and 3.74 seconds; these are not directly comparable with retrieval latency on a prebuilt index.
